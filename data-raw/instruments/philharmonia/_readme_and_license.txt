From the website:

Our library of sound samples has been specially recorded by members of the Philharmonia, and is free to use.

It includes all standard orchestral instruments, as well as guitar, mandolin, banjo, and a vast array of different percussion instruments.

The samples are suitable for creating any kind of music, no matter the style.

We would love to find out what you have created with these samples, so please get in touch and share your projects with us.

You are free to use these samples as you wish, including releasing them as part of a commercial work. The only restriction is that they must not be sold or made available ‘as is’ (i.e. as samples or as a sampler instrument).
