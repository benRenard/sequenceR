Description: A rudimentary sequencer to define, manipulate and mix sound samples.
    The underlying motivation is to sonify data, as demonstrated in the blog <https://globxblog.github.io/>, the presentation by Renard and Le Bescond (2022, <https://hal.science/hal-03710340v1>) or the poster by Renard et al. (2023, <https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-04388845v1>).
